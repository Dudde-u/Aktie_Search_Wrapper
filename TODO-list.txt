REFACTORING:
- Fix the MAX time option in the Response form buttons
- Fix the "backend" i.e the requests and the response objects i.e fixing ResponseHelperClass
- The Baseform is very messy and can be simplified
- Income statement and balance sheet forms can be simplified/optimized
- Validation can be made simpler maybe, but mostly the keyhandler etc should all be in one // optimized


FUTURE FEATURES:
- Add graphs and choose what data to show there
- Some LLM functionality which can in short describe the data
- List of owned stocks
- Some kind of Report generation and/or excel
- Making sure that data is not asked for too much -> creating local save of recent data (working on Archival class)

BUGS:
- Sliding banner is showing the global data twice
