COMPLETED TASKS:


COMPLETED REFACTORING:

- Fix the "backend" i.e the requests and the response objects i.e fixing ResponseHelperClass
- Make use of Interfaces to simplify the calls for SetObjectAsync and Archival class etc
- Validation can be made simpler maybe, but mostly the keyhandler etc should all be in one / optimized
- Archival class dataList writing needs to be corrected something is wrong there (almost everything was wrong)
- Make the ResponseHelperClass handle api call limits and null data


FIXED CRITICAL BUGS:

- Archival.GetData is not working -> DataList is storing too many values

FIXED NON-CRITICAL BUGS



IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:

- Making sure that data is not asked for too much -> creating local save of recent data (working on Archival class)
